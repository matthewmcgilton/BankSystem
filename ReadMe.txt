This project involved the creation of a bank system which is meant to process transactions. Accounts may be opened which are then placed in a binary search tree. These accounts can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money to other accounts. The main takeaways from this project was ensuring that all error and edge cases were accounted for along with how to best utilize data structures such as queues and binary search trees.
